A cultureevolves before our very eyes; how can we communicate with it?<blockquote><i>Recommended for: </i>fiction lovers, anthropologists, physicists,astronomers.</blockquote></blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>What things are hanging out inside Earth's sun?</li>	<li>What is the cheela's name for Earth's sun?</li>	<li>What was God's-Chosen's birth name?</li>	<li>What happens when cheela "sleep"?</li>	<li>What did the cheela do to Amalita without asking?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>What were the most vivid similarities and differences you saw between lifeon Dragon's Egg and life on Earth? Go beyond the physically obvious, suchas 'high gravity' or 'fast life.' How do living on these two bodies compareand differ?</li>	<li>In order for  this adventure to happen, some new technologies hadto be used that are on the fringes of today's science. What were some ofthem, and how far-fetched do you think they are?</li>	<li>Cheela and human's historical progress seem remarkably similar. Do youthink that this is reasonable? What do you think would have happened tothe cheela if humans had not made contact?</li>	<li>When the Cheela send information back to the humans, some of it is encoded.Do you think that this is a good idea? Do you think the humans would belikely to try to crack the code ahead of time?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Cradle_of_Saturn/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Earth/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
