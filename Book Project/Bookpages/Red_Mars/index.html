Who do you agree with most? </li>	<li>Mars was the god of war, but war seems to be a major import from earth. Based on real-life experience and examples from the book, do you think that this was inevitible?</li>	<li>On the cover of the book, Arthur C. Clarke says this "should be required reading for the colonists of the next century." Suppose you are such a colonist. What lessons might you learn from this book?</li>	<li>Who was the most interesting character in the book?

Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Pinball_Effect/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Rendezvous_with_Rama/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
