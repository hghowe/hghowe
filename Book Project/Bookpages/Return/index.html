But when disaster strikes his flight, the man who put him on the shuttle is cast as the scapegoat. And with his life and career in ruins, so may be his hopes for advancing America's space program. But when another catastrophe occurs, he may be just the man to save the day.<blockquote><i>Recommended for:</i> NASA enthusiasts, NASA critics, people interested in how the media affects people's lives, rescuers, forward-thinkers</blockquote></blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><B><FONT COLOR='#000066'>Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 20, 2001, for Mr. Howe's classes.</FONT></B><BR><B><FONT COLOR='#000066'>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading.
