Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Inherit_the_Stars/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Jumping_off_the_Planet/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
