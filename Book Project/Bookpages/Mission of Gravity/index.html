One human lands on a different part of the world, where gravity feels weaker, and negotiates with the natives to have them mount an expedition to find the missing rocket. This is a story of their expedition.<blockquote><i>Recommended for: </i>adventurists, technologists, people interested in the extremes of science, people who are interested in extraterrestrial life.</blockquote><font color="red">Note: This book is very hard to find!

If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe first.</font></b><ol>	<li>Life on Mesklin is described from both a human and Mesklin point of view. What do you think a Mesklinite would think of earth? Describe some surprises that they might meet with both man-made and natural situations, based on what they normally experience.</li>	<li>What do you think of Barlennan's final bargain? Is it a good one? Should both parties have agreed to it?</li>	<li>Barlennan is certainly an interesting character. Compare and contrast him to one or two comparable characters from human history or literature.</li>	<li>This book was written approximately 50 years ago. Do you think it has stood to the test of time? Does it still feel realistic, or are there problems you see with the story, perhaps based on differences in technology between 1950 and today?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><b><font color='#000066'>Deadline: March 12-14, 2001, for Mr. Howe's classes</font></b><p><b><font color'#000066'>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</font></b></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.
