Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol><li>Dr. Hawking has discussed a number of unusual topics, including the expansionof the universe, black holes, and the direction of time. Many people havesaid that reading this book changed the way they looked at the universe.How has reading this book affected you? Was there anything that you foundparticularly fascinating?</li><li>Of the topics that Dr. Hawking discussed, which one or ones left you withquestions that you would like to learn more about? Describe what you wouldlike to see investigated further, and (perhaps) how we might go about exploringthese ideas further.</li><li>Consider any two of the major topics (such as the ones described in thechapter titles) and discuss how they are related.</li><li>What do you think of Dr. Hawking's ideas about cosmology? What do you agreeor disagree with in this book?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Back_to_the_Moon/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Chaos/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
