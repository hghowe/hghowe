It is not a comet, or an asteroid, but a spaceship. A delegation is sent to this huge rotating cylinder to determine its purposeand possible threat to the solar system. A great story that has spawnednumerous sequels.<blockquote><i>Recommended for:</i> adventure lovers, explorers, spaceenthusiasts.</blockquote>Note: I recommend you read the samples at the end of the book forother good reading ideas!</blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>What was the first clue that Rama was not a natural object?</li>	<li>What are the contents of the cylindrical sea?</li>	<li>Ramans always do things in multiples of what number?</li>	<li>What kind of intruder invades Camp Alpha?</li>	<li>What step do the Hermians take to counteract the perceived threat of Rama?</li> </ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>"Gravity" on Rama was produced by rotation of the cylinder at a specifiedrate. Discuss the problems in daily life with this system.</li>	<li>If scientists were to discover a Rama-like object tomorrow, should we senda delegation?  If so, would you want to be a member?</li>	<li>Should Rama have been destroyed, when there was still a question aboutits ultimate purpose in our solar system?</li>	<li>Should a couple of people have stayed behind in Rama, to see where it wasgoing?  (This is part of the plot of the several sequels).</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Red_Mars/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../The_Return/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
