Are they reasonable? How well do they fit the evidenceof the book and "real life"?</li>	<li>This book was written over 20 years ago, and contains a lot of predictionsabout life in "the future." To what extent are these predictions accurate,inaccurate, or yet to be determined?</li>	<li>In many ways, this book is about the scientific method. Describe some ofthe good science and the bad science that is found in this book.</li>	<li>What is the significance of the title of the book?

Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Time_Machine/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Interface/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
