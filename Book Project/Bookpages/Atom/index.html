Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol><li>For what idea is James Maxwell most famous?</li><li>What is the true identity of "cathode-ray particles"?</li><li>Why is "packing fraction" important in determining which nuclei are stable?</li><li>What was the problem with beta-emission, and how was it resolved?</li><li>How many quarks do we believe exist, and what are they?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol><li>This book was published in 1992, and several possibilities that Asimovmentioned have been resolved. For example: the top quark hasbeen detected and its mass measured, and there is at least some evidencethat neutrinos have mass. Do some research on one or more of thesetopics, and explain how it extends and/or contradicts ideas in the book.</li><li>Asimov finishes the text with "It shows what asking the right questionscan bring about" How do people find these questions? Can youthink of others that could keep people occupied for over 2500 years?</li><li>Do you think that Einstein's (and many other's) quest for a grand unifiedtheory is possible? Is it relevant to humanity?</li><li>Asimov presented many ideas of various scientists that turned out laterto be wrong. This is the process of science, and it explains whyprogress is sometimes slow. Pick one of these wrong ideas, and tryto imagine the present world if this theory had not been replaced.</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center>Previous|Next</center></body></html>
