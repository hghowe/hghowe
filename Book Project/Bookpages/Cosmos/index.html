This is the book that made Mr.Howe decide to be a scientist when he was younger. It was the companionbook to a 13-part series of TV shows on science.<blockquote><i>Recommended for: </i>Good for all audiences, including peoplenew to astronomy, history buffs, and people who want to read an inspiringbook on science.</blockquote></blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>Who or what are the hunters and the floaters?</li>	<li>Why did we dig short trenches on Mars?  (Are these the same as thecanals?)</li>	<li>What were the people on the Voyager Navigation Team trying to do when theymade a surprise discovery about Io?</li>	<li>What is the Drake equation?</li>	<li>According to the Encyclopaedia Galactica, what is "Humanity's" probabilityof survival?</li> </ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>The author uses a lot of historical references as well as modern observationsabout the cosmos. (It is not unusual to see a picture of a probable blackhole facing a picture of Egyptian ruins on the next page.) How did thiscontribute (or detract) from the book as a whole?</li>	<li>This book was published about 20 years ago. A lot of science has happenedin those 20 years. Does the book feel dated? What did you notice has changedor been updated since this book was written?</li>	<li>If you get a chance to find the TV series that went with this book, (sometimesavailable in the "documentary" section of movie rental spots), how doesit compare with the book? (You don't have to rent the entire series; oneor two episodes should do nicely to give you a feel for the two.)</li>	<li>In addition to being an astronomer and space scientist, Carl Sagan wenton to actively fight bad science and mysticism. Do you see signs of theauthor trying to debunk popular myths in this book?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Cosm/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Cradle_of_Saturn/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
