Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>How much mass of fuel is needed to accelerate the Enterprise-D to halfthe speed of light, using the impulse engines?</li>	<li>Is the warp drive theoretically possible?</li>	<li>Is the transporter theoretically possible?</li>	<li>What Star Trek material is closely tied to cold fusion?</li>	<li>What does physicist Steven Weinberg consider the main mistake on Star Trek?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>Does reading this book add to your enjoyment of Star Trek? Or does it takethe joy out of it by pointing out what isn&iacute;t possible or making it alltoo technical? Explain.</li>	<li>Several times in the book, the author suggests that something is not possible,based on what we can do now and our rates of improvements. Do you agreewith his assessment? Is this a reasonable way of deciding what is or isn&iacute;tpractical?</li>	<li>Star Trek is a series of shows that deal a great deal with technology andscience, some real, some fake. In fact, there are probably a great numberof people who get most of their scientific understanding almost exclusivelyfrom shows like Star Trek. Is Star Trek doing them a service or a disserviceto these people? Justify your answer.</li>	<li>Suppose we decide that the universe of Star Trek is a nice place to liveand work. We&iacute;d like to make our future be the Star Trek future. What dowe need to do now to make that happen? Pick an area of future technologyand describe what you think we should do today to make a reality of thesefantasies.</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Mr_Tompkins/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Pinball_Effect/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
