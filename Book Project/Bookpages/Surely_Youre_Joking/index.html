They speak volumes abouthis dedication to science, his life habits, ...and his sense of humor.<blockquote><i>Recommended for:</i> People who would like to learn aboutthe life of a "curious character" who won the Nobel Prize. Future scientists,creative thinkers, and other troublemakers.</blockquote></blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>What poor choice did Feynman make that led to the title of the book? (Whyis it a bad choice?)</li>	<li>With whom was Feynman exchanging coded messages during the Manhattan Project?</li>	<li>On what basis did the army refuse to take Feynman for the post-war draft?</li>	<li>On what basis did Feynman refuse the University of Chicago's final offer?</li>	<li>What was the purpose of Feynman's committee for the California State Boardof Education?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol><li>When you read that the narrator won the Nobel Prize in Physics, you probablydeveloped some idea of what he would be like. (If you are reading thisquestion before you read the book, take a moment to think about it, andjot down some notes for yourself.) What aspects of his character were mostsimilar to your expectations? What aspects were most different? Do youthink that he makes a good role model?</li><li>In several parts of the book, Richard Feynman discusses his opinionsof the difference between good science and bad science. ( A couple of examplesare in "O Americanos..." and "Cargo Cults..." I'm sure you can find others.)What do you think about his opinions? What can you take from this bookto improve your own learning and science?</li><li>Do you consider Richard Feynman a humble person, or an arrogant one? Useexamples of the book to make your case.</li><li>Richard Feynman had many great things happen to him in his life: fame,fortune, intellectual freedom, success, even happiness. Which of thesethings do you think was most important to him, or was there something evenmore important to him? Use examples!</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Starfire/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Terminal_Man/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
