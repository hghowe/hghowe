Lederman, a Nobel prizewinner,uses humor as he goes deeper and deeper into the atom and the ways we discoveredwhat it is made of, up to the proposed Superconducting Supercollider.<blockquote><i>Recommended for: </i>people intersted in quarks, gluonsand leptons; future science researchers.</blockquote></blockquote><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>What is "the God Particle," in the author's opinion? What are two othernames for it?</li>	<li>At the beginning of chapter 3, why is Burger King listed on the map? (Whathappened there?)</li>	<li>What did the critics think about Maxwell&iacute;s theory of electromagnetism?</li>	<li>Why did Ernest O. Lawrence have an affinity for the letter "D"?</li>	<li>What was the author's first reaction to hearing a lecture in 1956 by MurrayGell-Mann?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>The author was (and is) a big proponent of the Superconducting Supercolliderproject, as you may have noticed. Does his writing seem biased? What doyou think about this project, based on your experiences as well as readingthis book?</li>	<li>The author tries to use humor very frequently in this book. There are manyjokes in it, about one per page at the beginning. Is this an effectivestrategy in writing about science? Did it make it easier or more interestingfor you as you read? Give specifics, including what did or did not work.</li>	<li>The research that the author expouses is largely determined to find thesmallest, most elementary particles, a search which is ongoing. Make upa debate between two imaginary characters about whether it is a worthwhileenteprise to continue. Make you debate as evenly matched as possible.</li>	<li>Much of this book talks about the smallest things possible. However, italso talks about some of the largest things possible. How do these twoconcepts relate to each other? (They are in the same book, yes, but why?)</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Genius/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Gods_Themselves/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
