Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><ol>	<li>Who or what is Skygrazer?</li>	<li>What does ZPE stand for?</li>	<li>What are the two main kinds of Tiberians?</li>	<li>Why did the Tiberians come to Earth?</li>	<li>Who are the Real People?</li></ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>In what ways are the Tiberians like humans? In what ways are they different?Go into more detail than just "They have two legs, but they'e coveredin fur." How do the two civilizations compare and contrast? How are theybiologically similar?</li>	<li>Towards the end of the book, there are a number of events which you mighthave noticed sounded a little similar to stories from religion, particularlyChristianity. What events of this sort did you notice, and what do youthink of them?</li>	<li>Race and slavery are recurring issues in this novel. How do the eventsin this novel compare or contrast with human history? (With human present?)</li>	<li>Buzz Aldrin was the second man ever to step on the surface of the moon,so he is quite knowledgeable about space flight. What do you think of hisvision of the future of manned space flight? What feels particularly realisticor unrealistic about it?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Einsteins_Dreams/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Enders_Game/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
