Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>		<li>How is the title of this book appropriate? What ideas or themes in the book are associated with the words <a href="../Terminal_Man/index.html">The Terminal Man</a>?</li>	<li>As you may find in this book, many things go wrong with the treatment, care and response to Harry Benson. What do you think was the fundamental mistake. You may discuss several theories for the fundamental mistake, but be sure to draw a definitive conclusion.</li>	<li>This book was written by a man in 1971, at at time when women's place in society was different than it is today. How are women treated in this book, and how is this treatment the same or different today?</li>	<li>This book discusses many implications of the relationship between man and machine, from the direct (electrodes in the brain) to the indirect (the lack of sidewalk cafes in L. A.). Thirty years later, to what extent are these arguments still valid?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Surely_Youre_Joking/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../There_are_No_Electrons/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
