Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br />Identify which essay features each of the following:<ol>	<li>A shower scene</li>	<li>A law that references itself</li>	<li>An eclipse in Hawaii</li>	<li>A guy from Harvard doing drugs</li>	<li>Low disease rates in Japan</li> </ol><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol>	<li>Consider two or three of the essays you read and find connections betweenthem. Do the authors agree or disagree on something? Do they approach thesame idea from different directions? How do these connections make youfeel about the topic? What conclusions can you draw?</li>	<li>Some of these articles are about "Science." The author just dives rightin and talks about a theory or discovery. Others start off with a personalexperience and relate it to a scientific idea. Which approach do you prefer?Give examples.</li>	<li>Which of these essays made you reflect or change the way you view the world?Describe this change or reflection, and how it has affected you.</li>	<li>Where there any topics that you felt were missing from this collection?Explain what they were and why they should be included in the book to completeit.</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Moonrise/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Mr_Tompkins/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
