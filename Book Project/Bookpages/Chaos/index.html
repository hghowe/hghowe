A look of the elegance andsimplicity that arise when things get too complicated for today's mathand science.<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Recommended for: </I>Math enthusiasts, computer scientists,and people that think that science and math are too idealized and aren't"messy" enough.<P>Note: for your graphical presentation, you may choose to write a computerprogram to calculate and draw one or more of the chaotic structures inthis book. See Mr. Howe for details.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Did-you-read questions:</H4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold"> Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; February 1, 2005.<BR>These should be easy questions, but you should have the questions ready and keep an eye out during your reading. Each question should be answered with 1-2 sentences.<br />Note: these questions are not probably not the most important part of the book! Your essay will <i>not</i> have to cover these questions!</span><br /><OL><LI>The Lorenz Attractor resembles what shape?</LI><LI>How long is the coastline of Britain?</LI><LI>What is the Mandelbrot set?</LI><LI>What was the power of Huberman's model of erratic eye movement?</LI><LI>Give an example of an object that displays self-similarity.</LI></OL><b>Report Questions:</b><p><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: Peer Review Session on February 8, 2005; paper due February 10, 2005.<br />You should write a 3 - 4 page essay on <i>one</i> of the following questions. Your essay should include examples and references to the book, unless otherwise specified. Page number references are sufficient for citing material from the primary book. If you use outside materials, cite your sources in full. If you would rather write on a different topic, you may, but clear it with Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first.</span><ol><li>Is the study of chaos worthy of being called "science"? Give argumentsfor both sides.</li><li>Some of the most complex results come from very simple equations.&nbsp;Choose a simple event in people's lives, and discuss how so many complexoutcomes can result.</li><li>Did <i>Chaos</i> give you a hopeful outlook on some of the technological problemswe face, such a weather predictions and noise reductions, or do you feelthat these problems can never be completely solved?</li><li>In many ways, this is a math text with applications across most disciplinesof science.&nbsp; Pick a specific physics application, and discuss whya knowledge of chaos theory is critical to its understanding.</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book. (This may include a brief summary of the book.) Give examples of what was cool or worthwhile in the book, and what you got out of it (or didn't).</li><li>Describe a (realistic) science idea that you learned about in this book, citing information from at least 2 external sources (other than the dictionary). If you would like help choosing or understanding an idea from your book, you are invited to come talk to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan.</li></ol><br />Note: This presentation should not be just a reading of your paper!<p><b><font color='#000066'>Along with this presentation, you should have a graphic that will go with it. A Power Point presentation is <i>recommended</i>, but if you have a special idea for a something else, such as a model, an original video presentation, or a well done drawing/ painting/ sculpture/ etc., you may do so, provided it involves a similar level of effort and polish. Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Brief_History/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Chronospace/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
