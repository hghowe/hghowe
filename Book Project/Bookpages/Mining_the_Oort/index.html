Peace is certainly a noble calling-- what do you think ofthe kind of peace depicted in this book? Is it effective? Is it pleasant?Should humanity strive towards or away from this political future?</li>	<li>In what ways does Dekker DeWoe grow up in this story? In what ways doeshe still need to grow up?</li>	<li>Do you think that this story is a plausible one? Did the author do a goodjob of making you believe in the science and characters in this book? Giveexamples of what did or did not work for you.</li>	<li>What do you think are Dekker's greatest strengths? His greatest weaknesses?How much of these strengths and weaknesses are a reflection of his beingMartian, and how much are they simply part of being human?</li></ol><h4>Graphic and Presentation:</h4><span style = "color: 000066; font-weight: bold">Deadline: February 21 - March 3, 2005.<p>You will give a 10 minute presentation on <i>both</i> of the following:</span></p><ol><li>Convince your peers that they should (or should not) read this book.

Speak to Mr. Howe or Ms. Sullivan first if you are considering an alternate graphic format to the Power Point.</td></tr></table><center>Return to the <a href="../../index.html">Book Menu</a></center><center><a href="../Maximum_Ice/index.html">Previous</a>|<a href="../Mission_of_Gravity/index.html">Next</a></center></body></html>
